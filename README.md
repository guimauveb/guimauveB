### Hi there 👋

My interests range from low-level stuff, operating systems, C/C++ to Python, Javascript and web applications in general. 

I share projects and what I'm currently working on.


- 🔭 I’m currently working on my website.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how operating systems work with OStep.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on C++ / web applications projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: guimauve.bo@gmail.com
